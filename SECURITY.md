# Security Policy

EmbCompare relies on several open source packages and therefore may carry on their potential security vulnerabilities. 
Our philosophy is to be as transparent as possible, which is why we are actively monitoring the dependabot analysis. 
In order to limit these vulnerabilities, we are in the regular process of upgrading these packages as soon as we can.
